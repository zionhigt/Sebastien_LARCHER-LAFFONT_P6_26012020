## To launch it properly:

	__Frontend__
*Once upon a time. There was a litle [Angular project](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/dwj-projet6.git) wich run anywhere !
Update has arrived. It lost his legs !*

	__backend__
*- Type "npm install" into backend directory*
*- Type "mkdir images" into backend directory*
*- Make based env/env template env.ENV files into env directory*

## Introduce

__Hi! Here is my before last training project.__

*I have to learn and write API's features to be able to make the frontend part run as well ! 
This API will be safe with OWASP fundation security recomandations.
It's going to respecting RGPD rules.
And it has been built as a REST API.*
